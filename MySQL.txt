Applications:


Types of Databases Management Systems:
Hierarchical Database
Network Database
Relational Database
Object-Oriented Database

Hierarchical Database:
In, Hierarchical Database data is structured in a tree like manner. Those data are stored in Hierarchical(top down or bottom up) order and also they are representated by parten-child relationship.
In Hierarchical DBMS -> parent can have many children, but in the case of children have only one parent.

Network Database:
The concept of network database model allows all the child to have multiple partents and also it helps to solve the more complex models like as the orders/parts many t many relationship. Entiites are organized in a graph manner which have an option to be accessed through several paths.

Relational Database:
Relational DBMS are mostly used DBMS model bcoz of its flexibility & easy to implement nature. This model is worked on normalizing data in database. Rational model store the data in fixed structures & manipulated them using SQL.

Object-Oriented Database:
In Object-Oriented Model concept data are stored in the form of objects. It maintains a structure which is known as classes & display the data within that. It describes the databases as a collection of objects. It also stores data members values and operations both. 

Advantages of Database Management System:
DBMS has lots of techniques to store, manipulate, & retrieve data.
DBMS considered as an most efficien handler to balance the data.
A DBMS uses alot of powerful functions to store, manipulate, & retrieve data efficiently.
Data Integrity & Security is one of the most strong part of DBMS.
The DBMS use data integrity to protect data and maintains the privacy.
Helps to reduced Appication Development Time.

What is Relational Database Management System?
Relational Database Management System(RDBMS)is used for the DBMS.
The relationship between data files in relational RDBMS They connect the data & the different files sed by common data numbers or may be using key concepts.

Properties of RDBMS:
Values are Atomic in RDBMS
Each row is different
Columns are different
Each column can have a common name
Integrity constraints help to maintain the data consistency for multiple tables

DBMS VS File System (Ref. Google)
DBMS VS RDBMS (Ref. Google)

What is Key in RDBMS?
Key concept has an important role in RDBMS. This technique is used for identifying the unique rows from table and also help to establish relationship among the tables.

Types of key in RDBMS:
Primary Key: A Primary Key concept is basically a technique to classify unique tuples(rows) in a table.
Primary key does not conatin null value.
Value should be unique.
Primary keys are not always to be single attribute/column and it can also be a set of more than one attributes/column.

Super Key: A super key is a set of one of more columns or attributes to uniquely classify rows in a table.
Super key is a superset of a candidate key.

Candidate Key: A candidate key is a ste of one of moe columns or attributes to uniquely classify rows in a table.
The all remaining attributes or columns except for the primary key are considered as a candidate key.
The candidate keys are also as strong as the primary ey.

Super Key VS Candidate Key (Ref. Google)

Alternate Key: Out of all the candidates only one gets selected for primary key and rest keys are known as alternate keys or secondary keys.

Composite Key: Composite Key consist of grester than one attribute to uniquely classify rows or records & tiples n a table.
None of the column can perform as a primary key.
So the combinatin of keys can be considered as composite key.

Foreign Key: Foreign keys are the columns of a table which refers to the primary key or another table and basically they acts as a cross-reference between tables.

What is Normalization?
Mormalization is the process of organizing data to avoid duplication & redundancy.
Helps to minimize duplicate data.
To minimize or avoid data modification issues.
To simpliy quieries.

Types of Normalization.
It is divided into few catagories:-

First Normal Form (1NF): Each set of column have a unique value.
It helps to prevent using the multiple columns to fetch the same row.
Each should contain a primary key that identifies all the rows a unique data.
The primary key is usually a single column, but if needed then more than one column can be combined to create a singe primary key.
After implementing FNF may be the data redundancy increases but each row as a whole will be unique.

Second Normal Form (2NF):
In the 2NF, relational must be in 1NF.
First Normal Form is not able to reduce the data redundancy.
2NF follows that there will not be any partial dependency of any column on primary ey.
It follows the concept of full funnctional dependency.

Thrid Normal Form (3NF):
A relation of a table will be in 3NF if it is already in 2NF and does not contain nay transitive partial dependency.
3NF helps to redue the data duplication.
It also support to achieve the data integrity.
If table as no transitive dependency for non-prime attributes, then the relation should be in third normal form.

Boyce and Codd Normal Form (BCNF):
BCNF is basically the advance version of 3NF.
It is more strict than 3NF.
To use the law of BCNF we need to mke sure tha our data is already in 3NF.

What is SQL?
SQL stans for Structured Query Language.
SQL helps to access & manipulate your database.

Data Types in MySQL
A data type s an attribute that specifies the type of data that the object can hold: integer data, character data, monetary data, date & time data, binary strings & so on.

Character String
Numeric
Data & Time
Binary


Types of Command in MySQL
DDL - Data defination language
Helps to define the database schema
Deals with description of the database
Also have power to deal with creating & modifying the structure of database object.
CREATE - this cmd is used to create the database. It also have some ibjects like table, index, function, views, store procedure & triggers
DROP - DROP is mainly used to delete objects from the database
ALTER - ALER is used to alter the structure of the database
TRUNCATE - TRUNCATE cmd is used to remove all records from a table which includes all memory allocated for the records are removed.
COMMENT - It is used to add comments to the data dictionary
RENAME - This is used to rename an object existing in the database. 

DQL - 
DML - 
DCL - 
TCL -
